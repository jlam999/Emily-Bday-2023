      Long distance was still hard as ever and the days seemed to move slowly. However,
      we kept a strong bond despite the time zone differences and the wifi problems. 
      The apartment you stayed in also looked hella nice.`,

      our first trip together and it was a tonnnn of fun. I remember getting drunk on like
      eight shots of rum or something then getting horny. I also remember having an amazing
      day from the beach, to the sushi, to the late night vibes with you.`,

      You had just moved into your new room at Plex and I had just come back from the first few
      weeks of class. We got Trattttttoria demi for like the 4th time or something. It was delicious.`,

      you wore a beautiful dress, and we had the perfect night after eating at Esquire. They even gave
      us free alcohol! The vibes were amazing and you looked sooo pretty the whole time. I love you so much.`,

    text: `Next came December, and you surprised me in Boston! I was so happy that I could barely focus on
      my finals. We got to see each other more during winter break too. This time, 
      we stayed in your apartment in Chicago while you were shadowing. Chris and Geoffrey came
      over one day and we had a lot of fun driving around with them and see the light show and
      Navy Pier. And Chris broke the charger to Pinkity which was funny.`,

      days before, but then I got you a bunch of flowers (pink roses!) and they fit your room and
      vibe very well. I really like this one picture of you. We then did a cute Valentine's Day date
      and had a lot of fun together. I missed you a lot when were on break. I hope we never do that again.`,

      spring break. I remember sitting near your Physio class waiting for you to be done and it taking forever.
      Later, I think we studied with Rachel, Atti, and Vina at Main after getting Mod for dinner. I liked the 
      vibes of being a student at the same college as you.`,
